# Dumpster diving

Dumpster diving is a basic technique which consists into dive into the trash, with the objective of finding security information that may help in the recognition phase of an attack.

Kevin Mitnick used this technique in the 80' to collect sensitive information of the organizations he wanted to attack, and it worked, so it's very important that this layer of security is considered in information security matters.
